# CodeRefactor

    Accessibility standards, update the site so it's optimized for search engines.

    The marketing startup xyz needed to update and refactor there website to make it more accessible and more optimized for search engine.


* HTML update

    Our job was to go over there HTML and replace all the div's element associated with diffrent classes to semantic html element syntax.

* CSS update

    We also went over the CSS and replaced a lot of classes with semantic elements using descendant selector (space), child inside a parents, which also helped us avoid all the extra unnecessary repetition.
