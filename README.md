# CodeRefactor
Accessibility standards, update the site so it's optimized for search engines.

* HTML update

The marketing startup xyz needed to update and refactor there website to make it more accessible and more optimized for search engine.

* CSS update

Our job was to go over there HTML and replace all the div's element associated with diffrent classes to semantic html element syntax.

* CSS upgrade 

We also went over the CSS and replaced a lot of classes with semantic elements using descendant selector (space), child inside a parents, which also helped us avoid all the extra unnecessary repetition.
